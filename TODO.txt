- implement custom interval chord type
- implement envelope speed
- explicitly-named note size, instead of calling it "mod wheel" or whatever.
- now that a note length can be assigned to each note:
	- implement negative fade-out correctly
- add a way for the user to notify the synth of a "next note"
  per voice. that way, the slide transition will work as it does in BeepBox,
  where the seam between the note is the halfway point of the slide transition.
- wavetable init uses custom prng instead of C rand
- fix spectrum pitch damping and reference pitch
- make enum values lowercase
- implement more noise types
- code formatting/structure changes:
  - make synth/fx-specific calls static rather than defined in the header.
    (the reason i did this in the first place was because i was thinking i
    should at one point make it possible to call these directly so that you
    wouldn't need to dynamically allocate memory for them. But now i realize
    such a feat is not possible considering delay lines.)
  - some synth-related stuff are still named "inst"

BUGS:
- vibrato starts from wrong beat in fl studio. Could either clap-wrapper not
  providing playback information (not likely) or my code being faulty. need to
  check with bitwig studio.
  (...does it? )
ACCURACY:
	- why doesn't this happen?

CUSTOM INTERVAL:
	in all my years of beepboxing i honestly have no idea what this does.
	i've never used it nor have i seen anyone that have.
	But i do know it makes the instrument monophonic so i'll probably share code
	because with the "monophonic"izer of the arpeggio chord type.
